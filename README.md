My to do list application enables users to add tasks using the "Add Task" button and view the added tasks on a list which has a checkbox above the added task. Once the checkbox is clicked, the added task will turn blur and will be crossed with a line which symbolises a task being completed.This web application allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. My assumptions include my app focussing on a single-user system and compatibility with modern web browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox,Safari etc
